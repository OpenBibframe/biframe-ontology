Open Bibframe: A github repository for open review of the LC Bibframe Ontology
==============================================================================

Current status
--------------

New domain and range work: [see commit](https://github.com/OpenBibframe/bibframe-ontology/commit/5c126cb91101df4bbef0c9c19f1e5f7945a262ac?diff=split) 

###Errors fixed so far:

1. Use of incorect term owl:SymmetricalProperty replaced by owl:SymmetricProperty
2. Declarations added for undeclared annotation properties  from skos and dcterms.
3. Declaration for foaf:Person as OWL class added.
4. Declaration for foaf:Agent added.
5. All uses of rdfs:Resource changed to owl:Thing.
6. Typo of bf:ContentAccessability instead of bf:ContentAccessibility fixed
7. Added two defined classes for (Work or Instance), and for (Work or Instance or Item)
8. Most properties now have a Domain and Range
9. Many data properties have more specific data types than rdfs:Literal. rdfs:Literal has been left in as a marker. 
10. Comments have been added as markers for problems noted on a first pass.  

###Known OWL issues
1. Some places where rdfs:Resource was being used should probably be replaced by a data property using xsd:anyUri.
2. Some properties lack domains or ranges. Sometimes the domain or range is given in a comment, instead of as an axiom.
3. Many data properties could object properties with ranges that have instances instead of textual values. 

##Syntactically Valid File
A fixed version of the original rdf/xml  ontology file is currently located at
 [bibframe.rdf.xml](ontology/src/main/resources/bibframe.rdf.xml)
This file is now legal OWL.

##Renderings

The modified file has been rendered in a variety of formats, using OWLAPI/Protégé.

### Manchester OWL Syntax  - [bibframe-protege.omn](ontology/src/main/resources/bibframe-protege.omn) 

```
ObjectProperty: bf:absorbed

    Annotations: 
        dcterms:modified "2016-04-29 (added inverse, updated range)",
        rdfs:label "Absorption of",
        skos:definition "Resource that has been incorporated into another resource.",
        dcterms:modified "2016-04-21 (New)",
        rdfs:comment "Expected value Work or Instance",
        rdfs:comment "Used with Work or Instance"
    
    SubPropertyOf: 
        bf:precededBy
    
    InverseOf: 
        bf:absorbedBy
        
```

### Functional Style Syntax - [bibframe-protege.ofn](ontology/src/main/resources/bibframe-protege.ofn)

   AnnotationAssertion(skos:definition bf:absorbed "Resource that has been incorporated into another resource.")
   SubObjectPropertyOf(bf:absorbed bf:precededBy)
   InverseObjectProperties(bf:absorbed bf:absorbedBy)
